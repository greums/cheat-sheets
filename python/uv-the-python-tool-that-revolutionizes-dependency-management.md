## 🤔 What is UV ?

UV is developed by [Astral](https://astral.sh/), the team behind the popular Python tool [Ruff](https://astral.sh/ruff). Astral is known for building high-performance developer tools in Rust, focusing on speed, reliability, and modern workflows. Their expertise in both Python and Rust ecosystems ensures that UV is engineered to meet the needs of contemporary Python developers.

UV is a modern Python package manager designed to simplify and speed up dependency management for Python projects. It aims to provide a fast, reliable, and user-friendly experience for installing and managing Python packages, addressing many of the shortcomings found in traditional tools like pip, pipenv, and poetry.

## 🚀 Unmatched Speed

UV is written in Rust, making it extremely fast for installing and resolving dependencies. Benchmarks often show installations 8 to 10 times faster than pip:

```bash
# Using pip (traditional)
pip install requests numpy pandas
# Took : ~30-60 seconds

# Using UV (modern)
uv pip install requests numpy pandas
# Took : ~2-5 seconds
```

## 🧩 Deterministic Resolution

Unlike pip, UV guarantees deterministic dependency resolution through an advanced algorithm. This ensures reproducible environments and reduces bugs related to version differences.

## 🔒 Enhanced Security

UV systematically verifies checksums of downloaded packages, reducing the risk of installing corrupted or malicious packages.

## 🛠️ Compatibility and Simplicity

UV is compatible with `requirements.txt` files and standard virtual environments. It integrates easily into existing workflows without requiring complex migration.

## 📦 Complete Management

UV goes beyond installation: it also handles virtual environment creation, conflict resolution, and lock file generation, offering an all-in-one solution.

## ✨ Modern User Experience

UV’s command-line interface is intuitive, with clear messages and modern options, making it easy to use even for beginners.
